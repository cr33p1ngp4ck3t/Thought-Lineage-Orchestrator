# Demo Script for Thought Lineage Orchestrator

**Target Length**: 2-3 minutes
**Mode**: Screen recording with voiceover

## Script Outline

### Opening (15 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the web interface at http://localhost:5000
**Narration**:
> "As AI agents multiply, we face a coordination crisis: How do multiple autonomous systems make coherent decisions? Meet the Thought Lineage Orchestrator—a Marathon Agent built with Gemini 3 that coordinates AI-to-AI reasoning."

### Problem Setup (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the problem input field with "Choose the pricing strategy for our AI tool" already entered
**Narration**:
> "Let's solve a real business problem: pricing strategy. This requires balancing conflicting goals—market penetration versus revenue maximization. Watch what happens when we run parallel reasoning agents with different priorities."

**Action**: Select "Parallel (Demonstrate contradiction detection)" mode and click "Process Problem"

### Agent Execution (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show loading spinner, then results appearing
**Narration**:
> "The Orchestrator launches three specialized agents. First, the Analyzer breaks down the problem. Then, two Planners work in parallel—one optimizing for growth, the other for premium positioning."

**Visual**: Scroll through the reasoning nodes showing:
- Analysis node (green border)
- Planner A node (blue border, focus on growth)
- Planner B node (blue border, focus on revenue)

### The "Wow" Moment - Contradiction Detection (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Highlight the contradiction alert box (yellow background)
**Narration**:
> "Here's where it gets interesting. The TLO detects a contradiction between the two plans—severity 65%. The agents are optimizing for incompatible objectives."

**Visual**: Point to contradiction details:
- Type: assumption
- Root cause explanation
- Resolution suggestion

**Narration (continued)**:
> "Using Gemini 3's deep reasoning, it identifies the root cause: One agent assumes freemium drives growth, the other assumes premium positioning maximizes value. Instead of choosing one, the Orchestrator does something remarkable."

### Intelligent Synthesis (40 seconds)
**Visual**: Scroll to the Synthesis node (orange border)
**Narration**:
> "It synthesizes a hybrid solution: A Dual-Track Monetization Framework. Freemium for individuals and SMBs, Enterprise pricing for high-value accounts. This isn't just averaging—it's intelligently combining the strengths of both reasoning paths."

**Visual**: Highlight the confidence score (96%)
**Narration**:
> "Notice the synthesis has HIGHER confidence than either individual plan. By resolving the contradiction, we've created a superior strategy."

### Graph & Audit Trail (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Scroll through stats showing nodes, edges, average confidence
**Narration**:
> "Every decision is traceable. You can audit the complete reasoning lineage—what each agent thought, why they concluded what they did, and how conflicts were resolved."

### Impact & Closing (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Return to top showing the full reasoning flow
**Narration**:
> "This is the future of AI coordination. As organizations deploy multiple specialized agents, TLO ensures they work together coherently. Built with Gemini 3's advanced reasoning capabilities, it solves tomorrow's AI coordination challenges today."

**Visual**: Fade to title card: "Thought Lineage Orchestrator | Gemini 3 | github.com/[your-username]/gem-devpost"

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Future-Ready**: Solves problems that don't exist yet (multi-agent coordination)
2. **Technical Depth**: Deep Gemini 3 integration for meta-cognitive reasoning
3. **Visual Impact**: Clear contradiction detection and synthesis
4. **Practical Value**: Real business problem with actionable solution
5. **Auditability**: Complete reasoning lineage for trust and compliance

## Recording Tips

- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
- **Audio**: Clear voiceover (use good microphone)
- **Pacing**: Speak clearly but don't rush—2:30-3:00 minutes is ideal
- **Rehearse**: Practice 2-3 times before final recording
- **Cursor**: Use large, visible cursor for screen recording
- **Zoom**: Zoom in on important elements (contradiction alert, confidence scores)
